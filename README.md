# MemoTest

Game to improve your memory level

## Description

MemoTest is a memory and attention game, in which participants must click on the boxes and guess the matching colors.

## Development

It is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In addition, I have used Cypress for e2e testing.

## installation

`npn run dev`: to run the program

`cypress-dev`: to run the tests

_you must first run the program if you want the tests to work correctly._
